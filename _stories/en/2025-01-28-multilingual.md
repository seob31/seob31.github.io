Hi, Everyone. Finally, I've applied multilingual support to my blog.  
**I initially tried using the tab function in markup to post in both English and Korean, but I found out that Kramdown doesn’t support tabs...**

I searched on the internet for how to apply multilingual support to a blog. While looking into multilingual support, I found lots of articles suggesting multilingual plugins.
I want to apply multilingual support simply, but using a plugin for it seems to require a lot of work.
After finding some examples of implementing multilingual support without plugins, I tried to applying a similar method, 
But it didn’t seem to fit the current theme structure, so I decided to apply it myself.

Not enough skills for it because it's my first experience using GitHub Pages, The design of the theme I selected is clean and nice, But it lacked many of the features I wanted, so I had to create and customize them myself. that's why I had to think a lot about How to apply to multilingual support to my blog.
I eventually found a good solution without using a plugin. It was dividing the layout into separate sections for Korean and English.
Finally, I made it.

Just in case anyone is curious, I'm gonna share the method on how to apply multilingual support to the 'Others' section in Posts.
